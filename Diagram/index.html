        <p>
          Các nhu cầu của con người được sắp xếp theo một thứ tự ưu tiên về tầm
          quan trọng. Trong đó,
          <span>Nhu cầu Sinh học được cho là quan trọng nhất</span> và vậy chúng
          phải được đáp ứng trước tiên. <br />
          Cha ông ta từ xưa cũng đã có câu: “Có thực mới vực được đạo”, cần phải
          được ăn uống, đáp ứng nhu cầu cơ bản để có thể hoạt động, vươn tới nhu
          cầu cao hơn. <br />
          Tại PTIT, sinh viên có những thói quen ăn uống của riêng họ. Họ có
          lịch trình riêng, sở thích riêng và cách chế biến riêng.

          Trong vòng 2 thập kỷ vừa qua, đã có thêm 5% tỉ lệ nam giới (Từ 38% tới
          43%) tham gia bếp núc và họ cũng dành nhiều thời gian hơn trong gian

        <p id="Explain">
          Ở nhà thì "cơm no áo ấm" là điều dễ hiểu rồi. Nhưng khi ở trọ thì lại
          là khoảng thời gian cần tiêu xài tiết kiệm. Và sinh viên thường bị gán
          với hình ảnh của những tô mỳ ăn liền. Tuy nhiên, sinh viên Bưu chính
          thì hầu hết đều tự tay chuẩn bị bữa ăn và luôn đủ 2-3 bữa mỗi ngày như
          khi ở nhà. <br />
          Một số bạn tham gia khảo sát chia sẻ rằng nghỉ ở nhà và giãn cách là
          khoảng thời gian tuyệt vời để thể hiện sự tự lập của một sinh viên với
          gia đình.
